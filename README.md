# Pofapi
## A fully functional python API library for POF.com

TODO: 
Add proxy support.

This was created after I came across a thread from the POF.com owners saying they won't be
creating a server-side API, which hinders 3rd party software development.

Hope it helps some developer somewhere get something neat built.

It's pretty easy to use.  Just create a new POFSession object and it's methods drive everything.


## Installation

git clone https://github.com/cmpunches/Pofapi.git

TODO: create a requirements.txt

## Usage

Create a POFSession object.  This is a really simple set of classes.

Most features require you to login with the object, but it will tell you what you need to do and
safely manage its own state for stateful features. 

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
