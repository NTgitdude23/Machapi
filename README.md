# Pofapi
## A fully functional python API library for POF.com

TODO: 
Add proxy support.

This was created after I came across a thread from the POF.com owners saying they won't be
creating a server-side API, which hinders 3rd party software development.

Hope it helps some dev somewhere get something neat built.


## Installation

git clone https://github.com/cmpunches/Pofapi.git

TODO: create a requirements.txt

## Usage

Created a POFSession object.

Most features require you to login with the object, but it's will tell you what you need to do and
safely manages its state.  Failure robust applications should be able to be build with it and I will actively
maintain the library for the time being.
